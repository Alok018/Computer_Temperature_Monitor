# Computer_Temperature_Monitor
This repo uses the lm-sensors to monitor the temperature of the onboard processor and other sensor data of the adapters.
You need to clone the directory **Computer_Files** into the computer to be monitored and the directory **RPI_Files** into the raspberry pi to be used as a server.
